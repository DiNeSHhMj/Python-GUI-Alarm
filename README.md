# Python-GUI-Alarm
This is a Python program that creates a alarm clock using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface, and the winsound library for the alarm sound. The user can set the alarm time using an entry field and enable the snooze and reset buttons once the alarm is set. The program updates the current time label every second and checks if the alarm should ring at that time. If the alarm rings, it disables the snooze and reset buttons and plays the alarm sound. The user can snooze the alarm or reset it to its default state. The program uses datetime and threading libraries to handle time and thread operations.
